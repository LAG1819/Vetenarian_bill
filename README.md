## Initial situation
My mother is a veterinarian and up to now she has created all bills manually. Much of it she often does multiple times and costs a lot of time. Many of the steps can be automated, which is why I wrote a small GUI for her, that creates the desired bill completely automatically after entering all the basic information.
